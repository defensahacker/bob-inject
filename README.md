# bob-inject

## Intro
bob-inject is the first web scanner able to mutate the URLS and inject payloads into the URL to find undiscovered bugs and security errors in web platforms.

It's use is RESTRICTED only for educational purposes or for pentesting professionals doing a pentest against a web platform with authorization.

bob-inject is perfect to pentest against SSTI, REST webserices, ASP appications, IIS webserver, etc.

It is an open source tool, I have added some useful payloads (batteries included) but you can easily add yours or contact me for a detailed and powerful payload list.

## Modes
1. Useful dirs
2. Useful files
3. inject sufixes payloads
4. inject REST API (enumeration or sql inject)
5. inject IIS shortnames

## Usage
```
./bob-inject http://www.example.com/admin index.php
```
